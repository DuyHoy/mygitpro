                            <p><strong>Developer Notes:</strong> Being able to hit Skirmisher 6 at level 6 makes for a

                                can be rather weak. We see wiggle room to add power into the 6 Skirmisher breakpoint,
                                which will continue to be strong in the early game, but might last a bit longer into the
                                mid game as well. </p>

                            <p><strong>Developer Notes:</strong> Tristana’s safe yet powerful rocket-propelled
                                assassinations have led to uncounterable gameplay that’s been difficult to balance.
                                She’s gone from being one of the most OP units of the set to being a dead unit, and
                                having that at any time in the game let alone as we approach worlds is just not okay.
                                With the rework below, we’re taking out her ability to selectively destroy the enemy
                                carry and leaning into her fantasy as the run and gun Hellion that makes your foes wish
                                they ran Cavaliers.</p>
                            <p>There is life, there is death and there is getting CC’d multiple times in a fight. Thresh
                                has been Unbound for too long, so we’re limiting his ability to cast consistently
                                multiple times in a fight. </p>

                            <p><strong>Developer Notes:</strong> We’ve tried a lot to make Draven work. We’ve even
                                thought about changing his name to Draaaaven, but we’re unsure on how many ‘a’s he’d
                                need to be A-tier. Draven’s current problem is that he needs 4 items to solve all his
                                problems. This change removes the need for Last Whisper and lets him build 3 items
                                that'll let him succeed, but we're pulling back on some of his damage output now that he
                                can opt into more damage multiplicity through items. If this doesn’t work we’ll try
                                adding more vowels. </p>

                            <p><strong>Developer Notes:</strong> The Zz’Rot changes are not something to Zz’z on.
                                Zz’Rots will now taunt units in a large radius but will not force any movement, meaning
                                that units who can attack from their current position will be taunted, while units who
                                cannot attack will not succumb to the petty insults of the Zz’rot.</p>
                            <p>Spear of Hirana has been underperforming the whole set, so we’re giving it a Radiant
                                bonus to make it a better consideration for comps with AP carries. Did I mention that we
                                buffed Heimerdinger? </p>

                            <h3>Updated Tutorial</h3>
                            <p><strong>Developer Notes:</strong> Our updated mobile tutorial goes live with 11.19. The
                                new tutorial is simple, fun, and evergreen (it’ll be the same regardless of the set).
                                Here are some of the specifics about it. </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Uses a smaller roster of champions from TFT’s first set</li>
                                <li>Uses limited items</li>
                                <li>Uses the new traits, Exemplar, which is like Nobles, but summons an extra large
                                    Demacian from the sky at its final tier</li>
                                <li>Has adjusted several traits and champions from TFT’s first set</li>
                                <li>It’ll bring you back to your glory days when you got first every game</li>
                            </ul>
                            <hr>
                            <h3>Tap Particle</h3>
                            <p><strong>Developer Notes:</strong> You know when you think you locked your car, but you’re
                                not sure, so you lock it again and it doesn’t beep back at you cause it’s actually just
                                a bicycle? Well, if your car did beep back at you, that would be an example of a closed
                                feedback loop, which would make you feel confident that your car is secure, and also not
                                a bike. Anyways, we’re adding a feedback loop into Mobile so you know your clicks are
                                going through. </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>NEW Tap Particle: When you tap on the board little poofs of TFT magic will appear at
                                    your fingertips.</li>
